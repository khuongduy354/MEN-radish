# Todo 

- implement cloudinary buffer + multer 
- implement mongodb pagination
- typing for models 

# Learned 
- index.d.ts includes custom property for request
- frontend should provide username -> less query on backend 
or should I get username from token ?
-> Extract username from token instead, it safer
- use ._id for queries 
- typing for model is hella important 

- use save() for updating mongodb, lean() for query, populate for references  
# Progress 
- User done except avatar (requires cloudinary setup)
